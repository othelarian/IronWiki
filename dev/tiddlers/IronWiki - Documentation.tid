! What is ~IronWiki

~IronWiki is a plugin for [[TiddlyWiki|https://tiddlywiki.com]]. It modify all the interface and change it to offer a better way to handle an [[Ironsworn|https://ironswornrpg.com]] solo play.

!! First goal

There is already a lot of great tools to play [[Ironsworn|https://ironswornrpg.com]], so why another way to do it? First, because I can, and it's always a good idea to have plenty of choices to do the same thing. Second, ~IronWiki took its inspiration from [[IronWriter|https://alexlarioza.com/IronWriter]], trying to have a similar interface, with the same concepts behind the history of events, but with [[TiddlyWiki|https://tiddlywiki.com]] as its core and going even a little bit further (or at least trying to do so).

So the main goal behind v1 is to be as close as [[IronWriter|https://alexlarioza.com/IronWriter]] in term of functionalities. For the v2, ask the Oracle.

! Usage

(Use arrows to reveal documentation)

!! <<doc-paragraph "$:/state/doc-switch-interface">> Switching between interface

<$reveal type="match" state="$:/state/doc-switch-interface" text="yes" default="no">
The ~IronWiki plugin add a special button in the toolbar:
<<show-btn "$:/plugins/othy/iron-wiki/iw-switch-button">>
<br />
And to come back to classic ~TiddlyWiki interface, this one:
<<show-btn "$:/plugins/othy/iron-wiki/buttons/switch-back">>
</$reveal>

!! <<doc-paragraph "$:/state/doc-change-title">> Change the title

<$reveal type="match" state="$:/state/doc-change-title" text="yes" default="no">
The title is easily editable by clicking on the button <<show-btn "$:/plugins/othy/iron-wiki/buttons/edit-title">> at the right of the title. Why this functionality? Do you know of to change the title of a ~TiddlyWiki?
</$reveal>

(More to come)

You want to use the ~IronWiki plugin, it's easy, you can download this file, manually or with this button <<show-btn "$:/core/ui/Buttons/save-wiki">>, or you can drag'n'drop the box below on an empty ~TiddlyWiki file:
